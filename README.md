# Face Mask Detector

A project for a robot that detects the face masks using OpenCV library.

A Python code for detecting the face masks depending on HSV color system using OpenCV.

The robot will capture an image using the attached camera with TXT controller from fischertechnik. And it will convert it into HSV model.

I used [ftrobopy](https://github.com/ftrobopy/ftrobopy) to connect and control TXT Controller, and the used robot was built using [Robotics Competition Set](https://www.fischertechnik.de/en/products/teaching/stem-robotics/519143-robotics-competition-set) kit from Fischertechnik.

Attached, the test sample of a black mask that is captured by the TXT Camera in the robot.
